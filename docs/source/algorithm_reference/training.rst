Training a Modified Causal Forest
=================================

Forest Growing
------------------------------------

Random forests are a group of decorrelated regression trees. Due to its non-parametric nature, the regression tree splits the data into non-overlapping strata. Subsequently, it computes the average of the dependent variable within each strata. These averages serve as the prediction for observations with similar covariate values. An issue with this approach is that using discrete, non-overlapping data splits can be inefficient, as it doesn't use information from neighboring data points. Additionally, the curse of dimensionality make it difficult to fit stable splits (or 'trees') with consistently good performance. Moreover, as the number of covariates increases, the number of potential data splits grows significantly. This can lead to exponential increases in computing time if all possible splits are evaluated at each node of the tree.

However, random forests solve these problems (to some extent) by building many decorrelated trees and averaging their predictions. This is achieved by using different random samples of the data to build each tree, generated by bootstrapping or subsampling, as well as random subsets of covariates for each splitting decision in an individual leaf within a developing tree. 

**Note**: the **mcf** differs from the causal forest of `Wager & Athey (2018) <https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2017.1319839>` with respect to the splitting criterion when growing the forest. Setting ``cf_mce_vart`` to ``2``, you may switch to the splitting rule of  `Wager & Athey (2018) <https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2017.1319839>`. 

Apart from the difference in the splitting criterion, the regression forest may seem much related to the ``mcf``. However, note that the underlying prediction tasks are fundamentally different. The ``mcf`` aims to predict causal effects, for which there is no data, and provides (asymptotically) valid inference. 
To impute the missing data, the ``mcf`` requires a causal model. 
To provide valid inference, the mcf borrows the concept of honesty introduced by `Athey & Imbens (2016) <https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1510489113>`. For a textbook-like discussion refer to `Athey & Imbens (2016) <https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1510489113>`.
