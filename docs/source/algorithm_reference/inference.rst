Inference
=========

The **mcf** offers three ways of conducting inference. 

- Weights-based Inference Procedure: This is the default method. It is particularly useful to gain information on the precision of estimators that have a representation as weighted averages of the outcomes. See `Lechner (2018) <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1812.09487>`_ for more details.

- Variance of Treatment Effect Estimates: This method estimates the variance of treatment effect estimates as the sum of the variance of weighted outcomes.

- Bootstrap Algorithm: This method uses a bootstrap algorithm to obtain inference.
